<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Convex Ultrasound Probe Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Longitudinal Wave Probe</li><li>Shear Wave Probe</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical convex ultrasound probe market includes two main types: longitudinal wave probes and shear wave probes. Longitudinal wave probes utilize sound waves that travel in the same direction as their propagation, making them effective for imaging soft tissues and organs. In contrast, shear wave probes generate waves that move perpendicular to their propagation direction, enabling the assessment of tissue stiffness and elasticity, crucial in diagnosing conditions like liver fibrosis. Both types enhance diagnostic capabilities in various medical applications.</p></p>
