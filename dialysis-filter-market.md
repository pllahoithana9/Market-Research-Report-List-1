<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dialysis Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Throughput (Kuf>20mL/h/mmHg)</li><li>Low Throughput (Kuf<10mL/h/mmHg)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dialysis filter market is segmented into high throughput and low throughput categories based on the corresponding ultrafiltration coefficient (Kuf). High throughput filters, defined by Kuf values greater than 20 mL/h/mmHg, facilitate efficient fluid removal and are ideal for patients requiring aggressive fluid management. Conversely, low throughput filters, with Kuf values below 10 mL/h/mmHg, provide slower fluid removal, making them suitable for patients with more stable conditions or specific therapeutic needs. These distinctions optimize patient treatment in dialysis procedures.</p></p>
