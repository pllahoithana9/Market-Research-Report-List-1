<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Trackers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Axis</li><li>Dual Axis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solar trackers market primarily comprises two types: single-axis and dual-axis trackers. Single-axis trackers pivot on one axis, typically aligning solar panels east to west to follow the sun's movement throughout the day, enhancing energy capture. In contrast, dual-axis trackers adjust along both horizontal and vertical axes, allowing for optimized solar exposure year-round by following the sun's path more precisely. Both types improve efficiency, with dual-axis systems offering higher energy output but at a higher cost and complexity.</p></p>
